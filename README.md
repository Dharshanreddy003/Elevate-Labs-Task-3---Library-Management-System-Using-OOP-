# Elevate-Labs-Task-3---Library-Management-System-Using-OOP-
Develop a mini system to manage books and users.

# 📚 Library Management System (CLI-Based Java Project)

## 📝 Description
This is a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based Library Management System developed using **Java**. The project allows users to **issue and return books**, as well as view the list of books and registered users.

It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using classes like:
- `Book`
- `User`
- `Library`

## 💡 Features
- 📗 Add books to the library
- 🙋 Register users
- 🔐 Issue books to users
- 🔁 Return issued books
- 📃 View available books and registered users
- 🔄 Menu-driven loop to perform multiple actions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **VS Code / IntelliJ**
- **Scanner class** for user input
- **ArrayList** to manage books and users
- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, Composition

## 📂 Project Structure
Single file: `LibraryManagementSystem.java`

Contains:
- Class `Book`
- Class `User`
